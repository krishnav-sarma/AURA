## 🚀 What is AURA?

AURA is not just a group — it’s a **way of surviving college** with people who:
- Help with studies 📚  
- Might ask you ₹200 (but don’t expect of return 💸)  
- Call at 2AM to talk nonsense 🛌  
- Cry together after internal marks 😢  
- Show up at events  🪪  
- Troll you so hard, you forget your real problems 🤡  

> “College is temporary. But AURA trauma is forever.”
